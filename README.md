# Boundary Element Method for Stokes Flow
Using regularized Stokeslets and Blakelets. Accepts both surfaces and splines as inputs, see D. J. Smith *"A boundary element regularized Stokeslet method applied to cilia- and flagella-driven flow"*. Surfaces are integrated over with 6th order Gaussian quadratures.

Requires C++ armadillo for solving.
